# Autism Spectrum Disorder Data Pipeline

This project was developed for the Radford University CS540 Data Engineering graduate course.  
It implements an end-to-end data pipeline in Databricks to clean, transform, and analyze Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) prevalence data.

## Project Overview

The pipeline focuses on global ASD prevalence, with an emphasis on how autism rates have changed over time (1962–2022).  
Cleaned and processed data are used to generate visualizations using both Matplotlib (Python) and Tableau dashboards for exploratory and explanatory analysis.

## Data Source

All data used in this project comes from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  
The dataset is a compilation of autism prevalence studies conducted by researchers from 1962 through 2022.

- **Dataset:** Autism Prevalence Studies  
- **Provider:** CDC – Public Health Surveillance  
- **Link:** https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/autism-prevalence-studies/9mw4-6adp/data_preview  

Please refer to the CDC’s site for full metadata, methodology, and any updates to the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Databricks** for data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Python / PySpark** for data processing  
- **Matplotlib** for programmatic visualizations and exploratory plots  
- **Tableau** for interactive dashboards and visual storytelling  

## Goals

- Build a reproducible data engineering pipeline around ASD prevalence data.  
- Clean and standardize multi-decade prevalence studies into an analyzable format.  
- Visualize trends in ASD prevalence over time and across studies using Matplotlib and Tableau.

## Note
The data and graphs shown is not a completely accurate representation of ASD rates as much of this data is not nationally collected.
